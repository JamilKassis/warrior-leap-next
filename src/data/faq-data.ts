    question: "How long should I stay in an ice bath?",
    answer: "Start with 2–3 minutes to let your body adapt. With experience, you can build up to 5–10 minutes. Never exceed 15 minutes in a single session."
  },
  {
    question: "What temperature should the ice bath water be?",
    answer: "For most users, 10–15°C (50–59°F) is effective. For deeper cold exposure, experienced users may drop to around 4°C (39°F). Our water chillers allow precise temperature control."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I take ice baths?",
    answer: "2–4 times per week is ideal for most. Advanced athletes may use it daily. Always prioritize how your body feels and adapts."
  },
  {
    question: "Are ice baths safe for everyone?",
    answer: "Cold exposure is powerful, but not for everyone. Avoid if you have heart conditions, severe circulatory disorders, or are pregnant. Always consult your doctor first."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maintain my ice tub and chiller?",
    answer: "Clean the chiller filter monthly, wipe down the ice tub surfaces weekly, and replace the water every 3 days to 2 weeks depending on usage. When changing the water, rinse the tub and clean it with a minimal, non-toxic solution to keep it fresh."

    question: "Do I need a water chiller for my ice bath?",
    answer: "A water chiller keeps your ice bath at a consistent temperature without the need for ice. It's ideal if you plan to use your ice bath regularly. Without a chiller, you'll need to add ice before each session. We offer standalone chillers and complete systems that include both the tub and chiller."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between an ice bath and a cold plunge?",
    answer: "An ice bath and cold plunge refer to the same practice — immersing your body in cold water for recovery and health benefits. 'Ice bath' typically refers to using a tub with ice or chilled water, while 'cold plunge' often implies a dedicated system with built-in cooling. At Warrior Leap, our products cover both — from simple ice tubs to complete cold plunge systems with water chillers."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does an ice bath cost in Lebanon?",
